    "When traveling, flight delays can be problematic for both travelers and the airline. For the traveler, they risk wasting time stuck in an airport or potentially missing out on time-sensitive events on arrival. For the airlines, delays can cascade into interfering with other flight landings, full day delays, and losing customers.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-3) As a result, understanding the nature of delays would be immensely valuable for planning by travelers and airlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many previous works looking for patterns in flight delays. For example, Mitsokapas, et. al. 's research paper attempts to create a statistical model for the probability of a flight being delayed by increasing amounts of time.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-3) While the overall model does not provide any new insights, the authors found that airlines tend to produce the most similar delay distributions within itself. YY’s article, on the other hand, presents a possible predictive model for flight delays. They find that flight departure time is one of the most predictive features for delays.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the variable of departure time is often inflexible for travelers, investigating why companies develop unique delay patterns may have more practical implications. However, the precise process and logistics of airline companies that lead to delays is unavailable to the public, meaning a different representation for airline logistics is needed. One interpretation of the delay of an airplane is that it is a measure of its quality. For example, if a company tries to make flights as cheap as possible (through paying workers less, lower quality equipment, etc.), then their flight could be considered lower quality and expected to have higher delays on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we want to use the financials of an airline company as an indicator for the quality of their flights and test if it has a relationship to their average delays on arrival.\n",

    "In contrast to general intuition, we hypothesize that airlines with higher profit margins may experience more delays and cancellations. This hypothesis stems from the idea that while these airlines are financially successful, their focus might be more on maximizing profits and less on operational efficiency. For instance, in pursuit of higher revenues, these airlines might operate with tighter schedules or overbook flights, leading to increased delays.\n",
    "\n",
    " Additionally, high profits do not automatically translate to operational investments for enhancing customer satisfaction; these airlines might allocate their profits towards other areas like shareholder dividends or expanding routes, rather than improving training or maintenance. Therefore, despite their financial success, these airlines could face more operational challenges, including delays and cancellations, due to their strategic choices.\n"

    "Dataset #1 is a collection of flight on-time and delay statistics for major US airports and airlines. The information is collected by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and has data ranging from June 2003 to August 2023, for a total of 133,196,476 flights. The important variables we are looking for are airline, airport, number of delays, and delay cause. These variables will allow us to analyze flight patterns and identify trends in delays and gain insights into the factors that contribute to flight delays. The metrics we are looking for are delay rate vs on-time rate per airline and airport route as well as the average delay duration, and our datatype is mostly numerical. Our proxies are as follows: on-time arrival rate as a proxy for airline efficiency and operational performance, delay rate as a proxy for the impact of external factors such as weather or air traffic congestion, and average delay duration as a proxy for the inconvenience and disruption caused to passengers by delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #2 is a collection of several financial variables (such as Available Seat Miles, Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile, and Revenue Passenger Miles) for the most popular 16 airlines as well as the total industry from 1995-2018. The important variables we specifically are looking for are the ones that indicate operational investment for each major US airline company, as measured by their average expenses and revenue per available seat mile. Some other key metrics we will be looking for per airline are: Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM),  Average Expenses per Available Seat Mile (EASM), and Average Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM). All our datatypes are numerical. Some proxies we may use are as follows: EASM: A proxy for operational investment for each airline. A higher EASM indicates that an airline is spending more on its operations, such as fuel, labor, and maintenance, and RASM: A proxy for operational efficiency. A higher RASM indicates that an airline is generating more revenue per seat mile flown, which is a measure of efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets could be combined to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to flight delays for each airline. For example, by combining data on flight delays with data on flight revenue, it may be possible to identify correlations between operational investment/costs and delay rates. We are also looking to analyze the relationship between on-time arrival rates and EASM for different airlines.\n"

    "During the initial stages of our project, our primary dataset in consideration is from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation which contains a comprehensive log of all domestic flights delays  in the US since 2018. It includes information about different types of delays including weather, security, system delay, etc. Possible ethical concerns related that could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bias and Representation: The dataset, while extensive, may not fully capture all the reasons for flight delays, specifically for  smaller airlines or less-traveled routes. There's potential for over-representation of dominant airline concerns or under-representation of issues faced by minority or economically disadvantaged groups who might be affected differently by such delays.\n",
    "2. Data Privacy and Sensitivity: While the dataset might not include individual passenger details, the granular break-up of delay causes could be sensitive. For instance, consistent security delays at a particular airport might raise unwarranted concerns among passengers, even if these were minor or non-threatening issues. Other potential security concerns might arise as we along with the project. \n",
    "3. Methodological Ethics: Underlying reasons for potential conclusions from preliminary data analysis might be ignored.  For instance, system delays could be a technological glitch, understaffing, or other factors. Misinterpreting or oversimplifying such causes could lead to skewed or non-directive analysis. \n",
    "4. Financial Data Interpretation: Adding financial revenue data raises ethical concerns about how this information is interpreted. Misinterpretation could lead to unfair assumptions about an airline's service quality or operational efficiency. High revenue doesn't always mean better service, as it can be influenced by factors like route popularity or pricing strategies. It's important to analyze this data carefully to avoid misleading conclusions about the relationship between an airline's financial performance and flight delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, other potential datasets that we could potentially use/merge would ideally contain information about Flight Times, Price Fare, Delay Duration, Arrival and Departure airport and specific airport information. There are potential ethical concerns attached to this too.. Firstly, the process of merging disparate datasets might lead to inconsistencies or biases, possibly skewing our findings. Furthermore, drawing inferred links between Price Fare and flight delays could inadvertently cast misperceptions about certain airlines' value propositions. On the privacy front, while individual identities aren't explicit, there's a subtle risk of indirectly identifying frequent travelers  through overlapped dataset details regarding frequently picked airlines to travel, frequent class to travel and whether its a cheap or an expensive one, etc. Finally, merging varied data can sometimes obfuscate the distinction between correlation and causation, leading to conclusions that might be misleading. As we progress, it's crucial that these ethical considerations remain at the forefront of our analytical work."
