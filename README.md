# Operational Airline Delay Data Science Project - November 2023

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the financials and operational delay data of 18 airlines over a span of 25 years. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), this study emphasizes data wrangling, visualization, and outlier analysis to unearth patterns and insights. We investigate the interplay between operational investments and the average delays incurred by these airlines, utilizing Linear Regression to assess the impact of financial decisions on operational efficiency.
