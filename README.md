Operational Airline Delay Data Science Project November 2023
▪ Conducted EDA of 18 airlines' 25-year financials and delay data, emphasizing data wrangling, data visualization and
outlier analysis.
▪ Performed Linear Regression testing on expenses and revenue, scaled by the average delay of each airline to test the
relationship between operational investments and average delay incurred.
